# classification-2d-gaussian
The Credit Dataset has two classes (1 for Good and 2 for Bad). Two attiributes of each class have used so it's a binary classification problem.
it's 2-D Gaussian. Partitions the given dataset as 67% training and 33% test. For each class, using the training
partition, does Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for 2-D Gaussian parameters: Meanand covariance. Plots each 2-D Gaussian.
To classify the instances in the test set partition, calculate unnormalized posteriors
depending on the Gaussians. Finally, Calculates accuracy regarding to the real classificatio of the data set.
